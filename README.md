# React PDF display and check system

Allows you to open 2 PDFs in the browser side-by-side (say, a French PDF and a Spanish PDF).  Are you worried that the layout/meaning of the sentences in both documents might be different (a common worry for people who do quality assurance checks of multilingual documents)?  Just highlight the French sentence and the Spanish sentence you'd like to check, click 'Check', and both sentences will be translated with Google Translate, and the results will appear in a popup window.

## Booooring

This is the kind of nuts-and-bolts translation industry scripting/coding I've been doing since 2017.  Not very interesting or generally-usable, so I've not put any of it on GitHub until now.  Unless you work in the translation industry/translation coordination industry, you probably don't want to fork this repo :)
